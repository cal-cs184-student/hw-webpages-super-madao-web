		<h2>Overview</h2>
		This homework walks us through the rasterization pipeline where we implemented from scratch functionalities allowing
		different sampling methods, texel to pixel mapping, and antialiaing effects. 

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		I first created a Vector2D object for all three coordinates and then sorted them based on descending y value. 
		The three edges that I set in my rasterizer are: p0 -> p1, p1 -> p2, and p2 -> p1. 
		According to triangle rules and the condition that p0.y >= p1.y >= p2.y, if p1.x < p2.x, then the left edges 
		are p0 -> p1 and p1 -> p2. 
		If not, then p2 -> p0 is a left edge. We store the info about which edges are left edges in a bool[]. 
		Then we start going through every pixel in the bounding box of the triangle and applying the pointInTriangle test. 
		Within the test, if the sample point lies on the edge, then we check if the edge is a horizontal edge or a left edge. 
		If so, the point is included. If not, they are excluded. 
		Depending on the result of bool pointInTriangle(), we decide to color the pixel or not.

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		The basic structure for the supersampling algorithm is to create a larger sample buffer based on 
		the given sample rate and the dimension of the actual image. 
		We multiply the x and y values for the given points in the rasterize triangle function by 
		the same factor of sqrt(sample_rate) so they match with the new sample buffer. 
		Then we go on to rasterize as usual. 
		As for rasterize point and rasterize line, we simply have to enlarge the original point (rasterize line is 
		based on rasterize point) to the new dimension of sample buffer and color the area into the same color as 
		before so it remains the same color in the sample buffer. 
		Supersample is useful for antialiasing in that it allows more sample points to be taken and therefore more precise 
		capture of the given image.

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		I changed the color of the cubeman and tried to make it look like it is jumping and saying hi. 
		I rotated the bottom two legs of the cubeman by -45 and 45 degrees each. 
		I also rotated the rightmost arm by 90 degrees.

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>

		The barycentric coordinate of each vertex refers to the proportional distance from this vertex to a given point 
		within the triangle. Thus, the barycentric coordinate of each vertex is a value between 0 and 1 
		(if the given point is indeed within the triangle). We can use this barycentric value to 
		interpolate values within the triangle as we need. For instance, we use it to interpolate 
		the color value of each point within a triangle with defined colors at the three vertices. 
		In the example image, the three vertices each have a distinct color. Depending on the 
		position of the point within the triangle, we calculate a different proportion from the three vertices to 
		get the color value we want for that point. We iterate this through every point within 
		the triangle to interpolate the color over the whole area.

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		Pixel sampling refers to the sampling practice of mapping a texture image onto a defined shape, 
		much like how sampling works for presenting an image stored in the computer onto the display pixels 
		for people to view, pixel sampling also samples from the texture to decide which pixel 
		matches to which color. Nearest sampling refers to pixel sampling based on the closest texel 
		from the given point. Bilinear sampling is based on interpolation of the 4 nearest neighbor 
		texels from the given point to produce an averaged value.

			</table>
		</div>

		From the comparison we can see that sampling using bilinear pixel interpolation presents a smoother image than 
		the nearest pixel. There will appear a great difference between the two if we focus on an image with a high 
		frequency (i.e. a strong distinction between two color regions). How this edge in between is portrayed 
		differently where bilinear pixel interpolation sampling will be much smoother than nearest pixel sampling. 

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		Level sampling is a part of the rasterization process to decide which level of resolution the texture of the 
		image will be sampled upon. The levels start off at level 0, with the full resolution. As the levels increase, 
		the dimension of the resolution decreases by a factor of 2. In this project, we implemented three options: 
		level zero, nearest level, and interpolated level. For the first option, we just choose to sample at the texel spaces' 
		full resolution. For nearest level sampling, we first calculate the float value of level based on the formulas given 
		in class and then round this value to the nearest integer, applying this integer level to the sampling process. 
		Lastly, for linear interpolation of the level, we again calculate the continuous float value for the level, but 
		instead we interpolate the two colors values from floor(level) and ceil(level) depending on the weight of the 
		level value. We use this value as the final texel to be sampled.
